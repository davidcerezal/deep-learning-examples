# deep-learning-examples #

1.- I will follow this book for the first examples:

https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python
(Available free in the third Google's option)

2.- For quick start with the enviroment, We choose a docker container with the lightest version of Keras and tensorFlow.
https://github.com/gw0/docker-keras

http://gw.tnode.com/docker/keras/

3.- Once you have installed keras and downloaded the image, you can run:
docker run -it gw000/keras:(???your_version???) python3

and run:
import keras

if the shells promtps "Using TensorFlow backend." or "Using Theano..." everything is ok.
